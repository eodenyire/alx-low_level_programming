# 0x00 C - Hello, World

This directory contains solutions for the tasks in the **0x00 C - Hello, World** subsection of the ALX Low Level Programming repository.

## Description

This section focuses on introductory C programming concepts such as preprocessor directives, compiling, assembling, basic I/O, and understanding data types.

## List of Tasks

1. **0-preprocessor**
    - Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
2. **1-compiler**
    - Script that compiles a C file but does not link.
3. **2-assembler**
    - Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.
4. **3-name**
    - Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
5. **4-puts.c**
    - C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the `puts` function.
6. **5-printf.c**
    - C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," using the `printf` function.
7. **6-size.c**
    - C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
8. **100-intel**
    - Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
9. **101-quote.c**
    - Script that prints a specific string to the standard error.

## Usage

Each task directory contains scripts or C programs with specific instructions on how to execute them. Make sure to read the README.md file within each task directory for detailed usage instructions.
