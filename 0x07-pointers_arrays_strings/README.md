# ALX Low Level Programming - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to the tasks in the ALX Low Level Programming sprint related to pointers, arrays, and strings.

## About

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. The tasks in this section cover topics such as pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, and common C standard library functions for string manipulation.

- **Directory:** 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

## Files and Directories

### Header File üìÅ

- `main.h`: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

### Tasks üìÉ

- **0-memset.c:** C function that fills the first n bytes of memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b. Returns a pointer to the filled memory area s.

- **1-memcpy.c:** C function that copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest. Returns a pointer to the memory area dest.

- **2-strchr.c:** C function that returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s. If the character is not found, the function returns NULL.

- **3-strspn.c:** C function that returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of memory area s which consist only of bytes from a substring accept.

- **4-strpbrk.c:** C function that locates the first occurrence in a string s of any of the bytes in a string accept. Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept. If no matching byte is found, the function returns NULL.

- **5-strstr.c:** C function that finds the first occurrence of a substring needle in a string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared. Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring. If the substring is not found, the function returns NULL.

- **7-print_chessboard.c:** C function that prints the chessboard.

- **8-print_diagsums.c:** C function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

- **9-set_string.c:** C function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

- **101-crackme_password:** File containing the password for the crackme2 executable.
