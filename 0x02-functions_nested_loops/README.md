# ALX Low Level Programming Tasks

This repository contains solutions to the tasks for the ALX Software Engineering Program, specifically focusing on low-level programming. The tasks cover various concepts including functions, nested loops, header files, and variable scope in the C programming language.

## Files and Directories

### Directory Structure


### Description of Tasks and Files

- **Task 0: _putchar**
  - `0-holberton.c`: C program that prints "Holberton", followed by a new line.

- **Task 1: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  - `1-alphabet.c`: C function that prints the alphabet in lowercase.

- **Task 2: 10 x alphabet**
  - `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: C function that prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times.

- **Task 3: islower**
  - `3-islower.c`: C function that checks for lowercase characters.

- **Task 4: isalpha**
  - `4-isalpha.c`: C function that checks for alphabetic characters.

- **Task 5: Sign**
  - `5-sign.c`: C function that prints the sign of a number.

- **Task 6: There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you**
  - `6-abs.c`: C function that returns the absolute value of an integer.

- **Task 7: There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important**
  - `7-print_last_digit.c`: C function that prints the last digit of a number.

- **Task 8: I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life**
  - `8-24_hours.c`: C function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer.

- **Task 9: Learn your times table**
  - `9-times_table.c`: C function that prints the 9 times table.

- **Task 10: a + b**
  - `10-add.c`: C function that returns the addition of two integers.

- **Task 11: School, 98 Battery Street, San Francisco CA 94111**
  - `11-print_to_98.c`: C function that prints all natural numbers from an input to 98.

- **Task 12: The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself**
  - `100-times_table.c`: C function that prints the times table of an input value.

- **Task 13: Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women**
  - `101-natural.c`: C program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.

- **Task 14: In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A**
  - `102-fibonacci.c`: C program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.

- **Task 15: Even Liber Abbaci**
  - `103-fibonacci.c`: C program that prints the sum of even-valued Fibonacci numbers.

- **Task 16: In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+**
  - `104-fibonacci.c`: C program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired task solution.
3. Compile the C file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 FILENAME.c -o EXECUTABLE_NAME`).
4. Run the executable (e.g., `./EXECUTABLE_NAME`).
5. Check the output to verify the correctness of the solution.
