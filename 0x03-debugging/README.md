# ALX Low Level Programming: Debugging Section

This repository contains solutions developed by Emmanuel Odenyire Anyira for the debugging section of the ALX Software Engineering Program's Low Level Programming sprint.

## Overview

In this section, we focus on debugging techniques in C programming. Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software to ensure it runs correctly. Throughout this section, we explore various debugging methods, manual debugging techniques, reading error messages, and using debugging tools such as gdb.

## Tasks

1. **Multiple mains**
   - Description: Create a main file to test the `positive_or_negative()` function with a case of 0.
   - File(s): `0-main.c`, `main.h`

2. **Like, comment, subscribe**
   - Description: Fix a code causing an infinite loop by commenting out the problematic section.
   - File(s): `1-main.c`

3. **0 > 972?**
   - Description: Fix a function to correctly determine the largest of three numbers.
   - File(s): `2-largest_number.c`, `main.h`

4. **Leap year**
   - Description: Fix a function to accurately handle leap years and calculate remaining days in a year.
   - File(s): `3-print_remaining_days.c`, `main.h`

## Usage

To use these solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the task you want to test.
3. Compile the necessary files using `gcc`.
4. Execute the compiled program to see the output.
5. Make any necessary adjustments or modifications as needed.
