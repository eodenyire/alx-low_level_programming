# C - Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains solutions to the tasks in the "C - Variables, if, else, while" section of the ALX Software Engineering Program.

## Description

This section covers basic concepts in C programming including variables, arithmetic operators, logical operators, if statements, loops, and more. Each task focuses on a specific concept and requires writing a C program to demonstrate understanding of that concept.
