# ALX Low Level Programming - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This repository contains solutions to tasks from the ALX Low Level Programming sprint, specifically focused on More Functions and More Nested Loops.

## Author

This project is authored by Emmanuel Odenyire Anyira, a student at ALX Africa currently undertaking the ALX Software Engineering Program.

## Description

In this sprint, various C functions are implemented to achieve specific tasks as outlined in the project requirements. Each task has its own C file with an implementation of the required function, adhering to the given prototypes and requirements. Additionally, a header file `main.h` is provided with function prototypes and a Makefile to facilitate compilation.

## Tasks Overview

Here's a brief overview of the tasks covered in this sprint along with the corresponding file names:

- **Task 0: isupper**
  - File: `0-isupper.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to check for uppercase characters.

- **Task 1: isdigit**
  - File: `1-isdigit.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to check for digits (0 through 9).

- **Task 2: Collaboration is multiplication**
  - File: `2-mul.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to multiply two integers.

- **Task 3: The numbers speak for themselves**
  - File: `3-print_numbers.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to print numbers from 0 to 9.

- **Task 4: I believe in numbers and signs**
  - File: `4-print_most_numbers.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to print numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.

- **Task 5: Numbers constitute the only universal language**
  - File: `5-more_numbers.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to print numbers from 0 to 14 ten times.

- **Task 6: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**
  - File: `6-print_line.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to print a straight line in the terminal.

- **Task 7: I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe**
  - File: `7-print_diagonal.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to print a diagonal line in the terminal.

- **Task 8: You are so much sunshine in every square inch**
  - File: `8-print_square.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to print a square.

- **Task 9: Fizz-Buzz**
  - File: `9-fizz_buzz.c`
  - Description: Implement a program to print numbers from 1 to 100 with FizzBuzz conditions.

- **Task 10: Triangles**
  - File: `10-print_triangle.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to print a triangle.

- **Task 11: The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers...**
  - File: `100-prime_factor.c`
  - Description: Implement a program to find the largest prime factor of a given number.

- **Task 12: Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper**
  - File: `101-print_number.c`
  - Description: Implement a function to print an integer without using arrays, pointers, or long data types.

## Instructions for Compilation

Each task comes with compilation instructions. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-isupper.c -o 0-isupper
./0-isupper
