# ALX Low Level Programming Sprint

This repository contains solutions to the tasks in the ALX Low Level Programming sprint. These tasks cover various concepts such as pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language.

## Tasks

1. **98 Battery st.**
    - Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

2. **Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**
    - Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

3. **This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**
    - Write a function that returns the length of a string.

4. **I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**
    - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

5. **I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**
    - Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

6. **A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes**
    - Write a function that reverses a string.

7. **Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**
    - Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

8. **Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**
    - Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

9. **Arrays are not pointers**
    - Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

10. **strcpy**
    - Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

11. **Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers**
    - Write a function that convert a string to an integer.

12. **Don't hate the hacker, hate the code**
    - Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

## How to Use

Each task has its own C file. To compile and run the C files, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eodenyire/alx-low_level_programming.git

Navigate to the directory of the specific task:
bash
Copy code
cd alx-low_level_programming/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
Compile the C file along with the main file (if provided) using GCC:
bash
Copy code
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <main.c> <task-file.c> -o <output-file>
Run the compiled program:
bash
Copy code
./<output-file>
