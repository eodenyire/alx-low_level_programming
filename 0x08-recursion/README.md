# ALX Low Level Programming - Recursion

This repository contains solutions to the recursion tasks in the ALX Low Level Programming curriculum. Each task is implemented in C programming language and follows specific requirements outlined in the project instructions.

## About

In this project, I learned about recursion in C.

## Files and Directories

- **main.h:** Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

### Files:

1. **0-puts_recursion.c:** Function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
2. **1-print_rev_recursion.c:** Function that prints a string in reverse.
3. **2-strlen_recursion.c:** Function that returns the length of a string.
4. **3-factorial.c:** Function that returns the factorial of a given number.
5. **4-pow_recursion.c:** Function that returns the value of a number x raised to the value of an input y.
6. **5-sqrt_recursion.c:** Function that returns the natural square root of a number.
7. **6-is_prime_number.c:** Function that checks if an integer is a prime number.
8. **7-is_palindrome.c:** Function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
9. **100-wildcmp.c:** Function that compares two strings s1 and s2, where s2 can contain the special character *.

## How to Use

To compile these programs, ensure you have a C compiler like `gcc` installed on your system. Then, compile using the following format:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c <file_name.c> -o <output_file_name>

Replace <file_name.c> with the name of the C file you want to compile and <output_file_name> with the desired name of the output executable.
